# MuKumari

This is intended as an easy-to-use playground for quickly setting up multi-agent scenarios in simulated environments with user-specifiable characteristics.

The name is taken from two "lost islands", Mu and Kumari Kandam. The former represents "an island of untold treasure", i.e. our hope for new discoveries on multi-agent inference realized through this playground setup; the latter represents "the hidden, true origins of a group", i.e. the hidden, underlying true intentions of the agents that can be uniquely exposed in this playground, unlike in the real world.
